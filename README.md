# Dell Latitude 7490 Hackintosh EFI - Catalina Branch

#### Latest update:

###### 2020/06/11 : 
OpenCore 0.5.8 with OpenCanopy & Boot Chime enabled
Catalina 10.15.5 
SMBIOS MacBookPro15,2
BIOS 1.14.0 (SecureBoot Off)

What Do Not Work Yet: 
- Touchpad Buttons (No hope)
- Micro SD Card Reader (Disabled on purpose as it kernel panics on Wake)
- Sleep (Device sleeps fine, but upon wake system freezes)
- SideCar (only works on wired mode)
- Fn Speciality Keys (not fully mapped for brightness yet. I believe one of the Kext is conflicting)

Everything else works very well!
